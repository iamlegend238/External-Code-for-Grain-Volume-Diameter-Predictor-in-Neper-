# External-Code-for-Grain-Volume-Diameter-Predictor-in-Neper-
We can use this code for predicting the diameter/ volume of each grain in the microstructure obtained through neper. The neper microstructure had finite elements which can be evaluated of the volume so that the sum of all the elements in the microstructure must give the volume of the domain chosen.
